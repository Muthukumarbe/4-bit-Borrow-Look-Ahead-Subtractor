Explanation of the Code:

1.Inputs and Outputs:
 A[3:0]: Minuend (4-bit).
 B[3:0]: Subtrahend (4-bit).
 Bin: Initial borrow input (0 in most cases).
 Diff[3:0]: Difference result.
 Bout: Final borrow output.
2.Propagate and Generate Logic:
 G: Borrow generate signals. A borrow is generated if the corresponding bit of the minuend is less than the subtrahend (G = ~A & B).
 P: Borrow propagate signals. If the bits are unequal (P = A ^ B), the borrow is propagated.
3.Borrow Look-Ahead Logic:
 The borrow for each bit is calculated using both the generate and propagate signals from the current and previous bits.
 The internal borrows (B_int[0], B_int[1], etc.) are computed in parallel.
4.Difference Calculation:
 The difference is calculated as Diff = A ^ B ^ Borrow, using the calculated borrows for each bit.
